                ADVENTURER</h3>
            <p>Around the time of the rank 0 adventurer the Black Emperor's retirement.
                The news hit the world with an even stronger impact than the slaying of the Black Dragon did and sent
                the world into a frenzy. After all, when it comes to rank 0 adventurers, they are truly the last line of
                defense for mankind and are an important existence needed to oppose the monsters who are ruled by the 5
                demon kings.
                The Black Emperor in particular, is very mysterious and was brought to the guild by the former rank 0
                adventurer “Sword Saint” Kurul. Their background, age and name are all of course unknown. There were
                rumors that they were a child based on their height and that the former rank 0 adventurer gave them a
                special recommendation when they registered as an adventurer. The Black Emperor demonstrated their real
                powers and in a little over a year became a rank 0 adventurer. Having such unprecedented powers, he was
                left with many quests from powerful figures from various countries. He had become an irreplaceable
                figure.
                Now such an important adventurer has retired. Of course, the adventurer guild tried to prevent his
                retirement. They requested the person who originally brought the Black Emperor to the guild, “Sword
                Saint” Kurul to detain him but they refused to do so. Afterwards, every country tried their best to
                somehow persuade him from retiring. However, their opponent was a rank 0 adventurer. The Black Emperor
                was easily able to lose the eyes of the spies monitoring him and slipped into hiding. Three years have
                passed since the disappearance of the Black Emperor.
                <br>“Haa… I can finally see it.”<br>
                I… Bran looked out at the city from afar and gave a smile. The reason being that I had started a new
                life since coming down here and have been living in the woods for 3 years now. I can’t help but look
                forward to what’s up ahead.
                <br>“Well, it took me forever to be able to use this guy, didn’t it?” I said looking down at the sword
                down beside me.<br>
            </p>

            </div>
            The me before used magic to fight but now another method of fighting was needed to live this new life. I
            decided to retrain and hone the sword that I originally had been taught by my master 3 years ago. I have
            finally become an acceptable skilled swordsman, so it was time for me to leave the heart of the woods
            that I had been training in and start my second life.
            <br>“Well, I guess the most important thing is to not use weapons in my second life.”<br>
            That’s right, I don’t need weapons in my desired new life. However, carrying a weapon is essential in
            this world where the monsters of the demon kings run rampant. I’m going to register as an adventurer
            now. The adventurer guild probably doesn’t allow people who don’t have a method of fighting after all,
            so I had to train my sword a bit.
            <br>“At any rate, let’s head to the city.”<br>
            I turned to the direction of the city again and started walking.
            <br>“Wow.”<br>
            I safely arrived in the city and was lightly in awe of the scene in front of me. There was just the
            perfect amount of people out in the streets of the city. I was especially surprised because of the fact
            that the city is Kureto of the Rireito Kingdom. The Rireito Kingdom itself is a small country and
            actually has a low population when compared to the bigger countries.
            Furthermore, it’s probably a characteristic of the country but the atmosphere in the air was warm, and I
            had already started to feel it myself. Despite being a small country, as far as I could see they have
            everything needed for survival, making it very convenient.
            <br>“It’s really calm. I’ve had enough of crowded places…”<br>
            I once used the biggest country in the continent, the Ledion Kingdom, as my base. Furthermore, I lived
            in the capital city of all places. The adventurer headquarters was based there so the foot traffic was
            horrendous. I can’t stand places with a lot of people. This Rireito Kingdom had fewer crowds but it was
            adjacent from the 3rd Demon King’s dwelling, the Demon Forest. In particular, Kureto is the closest city
            to the forest. I haven’t heard much of monsters leaking out of the ‘Demon Forest’ but compared to other
            areas, there are more monster sightings and there are a lot of soldiers and adventurers that live here.
            This is exactly why I chose this country. Of course, adventurers who slay monsters are valuable but due
            to the fact that there are a lot of monsters, it’s more difficult to harvest herbs in contrast to other
            countries. Therefore, even amongst adventurers there are an abundance of odd job quests.
            <br>“...”<br>
            While I reflect about this city I face the adventurers guild. The building is on the main street of the
            city. There’s a lot of people. Although, compared to the headquarters it’s negligible. While staring at
            the guild I overheard a fellow adventurer’s conversation.
            <br>“I wonder when we’ll be able to break through the 1st Demon King’s territory.”<br>
            “There’s no way we can. That place is on another level of danger. Unless the Special rank adventurers
            form a party then we won’t be able to conquer it.”<br>
            “I guess you’re right after all… rather, speaking of Special rank adventurers, what happened to that
            Black Emperor?”<br>
            “Who knows? It seems like the guild and the big wigs of every country tried their best to find him but
            they couldn’t find him at all.”<br>
            “As expected, he’s a different beast… Wait, isn’t he a former Special rank? At any rate, he’s insanely
            strong. But, I wonder why he suddenly retired? According to the rumors he’s still young right?”<br>
            “No clue. Nobody knows but there must’ve been a reason why.”<br>
            “...”<br>
            I was fed up from the coincidental conversation I overheard from the fellow adventurers. The topic still
            comes up despite retiring from the rank 0 class over 3 years ago... They’d never guess that I’d be
            standing here trying to register as an adventurer would they. I stepped into the guild. There was even a
            small tavern inside, with blacked out drunk adventurers sitting in there. I continued inside towards the
            front desk, due to the fact that I had already decided to do so. There’s a decent line in front of the
            reception desk, I have to wait a short while.
            <br>“Next—”<br>
            “Hello”<br>
            “Welcome to the Kret branch. What matters do you have today?”<br>
            “I’d like to register as an adventurer...”<br>
            “Understood! Can I have your name?”<br>
            “Bran.”<br>
            “I see, Bran.”<br>
            The receptionist started handling something in her hands. Then, a plate appeared out of the strange box
            attached to the front desk. The receptionist grabbed it and then handed it over to me.
            <br>“Now then, can you charge up your magical powers in order to properly measure and record it?”<br>
            “Okay”<br>
            I followed the receptionist’s directions and charged up my magic into the plate handed to me.
            </p>
            <p class="image-box" style="text-align: center;"><img
                    src="https://github.com/flowerstranslations/images/blob/main/bth-1-1.jpg?raw=true"></p>
            <p>If I was to get careless out of habit, I might end up displaying my real magical powers which I don't
                intend on displaying, so I held back. The reason being that my magic powers are terrifyingly strong. If
                I were to use my normal magic powers then it’d probably destroy this crystal plate. And… that might lead
                to someone finding out my real magic capabilities. That’s why, in order to not be found out, I should
                refrain from releasing my magic as much as possible.
                While being careful of the degree of magic power I use, the crystal plate absorbs a portion of my magic.
                Once it stopped absorbing my magic, my name and the words “rank 10” emerged onto the crystal plate. I’ve
                seen this phenomenon twice but I don’t remember the first time very well. At that time, my master made
                me register without even knowing what was going on. That’s why, it was strange to see it intently first
                hand. The receptionist smiled when she looked at my plate.
                <br>“Thank you. This will be your adventurer license. An adventurer license is needed when accepting
                quests
                as well as completing them. So please don’t lose it and keep it safe. You can be issued a replacement in
                the case of losing it, however there is a replacement fee.”<br>
                “That is all. Your registry is completed. I’ll now explain how the guild works now.”<br>
                The receptionist then explained the fundamentals of the guild. Which was about the types of quests, how
                to accept a quest, adventurer ranks, promotion requirements and so on but, it was a bunch of useless
                information for me. Since I’ve already decided what kind of quests I was going to accept and I had no
                intentions of promoting ranks. The receptionist then took a deep breath after her long explanation.
                <br>“Phew… The introduction is now finished.”<br>
                “Thank you.”<br>
                “Oh, It’s a little late into the conversation but my name is Rina. I hope your future endeavors go
                well.”<br>
                The receptionist— Rina, had a vague smile. I then left the front desk. Unfortunately, I don’t intend on
                doing much. What I want to do is… a goal of my new adventurer life.
                After leaving the reception desk, instead of immediately accepting a quest I left the guild and headed
                to a different location. I was on my way to a real estate agency. Usually most adventurers live in inns
                though it’s a different story if they’ve lived here before their adventurer days. Adventurers mainly
                slay monsters so they spend their money on equipment maintenance, so there’s hardly any homeowner
                adventurers. Sometimes a party of rank 4 or above would pool money together and rent a house as a base.
                It’s very rare to see someone have a house to themselves. However, luckily due to my 3 years of service,
                I’ve saved an abundance of funds.
                <br>“I had nothing but quests from royal members and rich merchants so I’ve saved a huge amount of
                money.”<br>
                The me at that time… before slaying the Black Dragon… vaguely lived just for that purpose. I didn’t have
                anything in particular that I wanted to do. I only became an adventurer and rose the ranks because my
                master told me to do so. I then completed quest after quest as they came fluttering in. I couldn’t
                imagine that this would be the catalyst for discovering what I wanted to do.
                Anyways, all I did in the past was save up money and I didn’t have opportunities to use it nor did I
                have anything that I wanted to buy, but now I’m going to buy a house on this land. Renting a house or
                even sleeping at an inn would suffice if you were planning on just sleeping there but I’ve heard that
                having a place you can come back to whenever is nice. I don’t exactly know that feeling yet but that’s
                what my master told me.
                I’ve come this far so I’m not going to rent a house but instead I’m going to own one. I like the vibe
                and environment of this city, so I hope I can find a nice house here. I finally reached the real estate
                agency at the end of my thought. An employee quickly came to greet me after entering the building.
                <br>“Welcome.”<br>
                “I’m looking to buy a house…”<br>
                “Is that so! Is there anything in particular that you’re looking for?”<br>
                Hmm, anything in particular huh... I haven’t thought that far ahead yet. I’ve only been thinking about a
                place to return to and to spend money on. Although, since I’m buying a house I might as well get one
                that is pretty big. Some people prefer small places to relax in, but for some reason I’m leaning towards
                a big place. At any rate, I should think of what else I want... Oh right, I’d like a place with a bath.
                My master also taught me that baths felt better than showers. They once said that baths clean your
                heart. Inns typically don’t have baths in their rooms. I only saw it in the house that I lived in with
                my master.
                <br>“Are there any houses that have a lot of space and a bath?”<br>
                “There is one. Though, it’s on the outskirts of the city... And due to the fact that it is placed near
                the plains, I can’t guarantee that you wouldn’t experience any attacks by the neighboring monsters.”<br>
                I see, indeed, if it’s near the plains then there’s a cause for worry for monster attacks even if you
                have a defensive wall. Though, that doesn’t really apply to me.
                <br>“I’m okay with that. Is it possible to check the house out in person?”<br>
                “Of course!”<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            <div class="ad-box">
                <script async type="application/javascript" src="https://a.magsrv.com/ad-provider.js"></script>
                <ins class="eas6a97888e2" data-zoneid="5581200"></ins>
                <script>(AdProvider = window.AdProvider || []).push({ "serve": {} });</script>
                </p>
                <p>
                The employee immediately led me to the outskirts, and I visited the house. The house isn’t as big as an
                inn though it was quite bigger than a house in the city. It even has a courtyard. The house was also
                more or less furnished, my desired huge bath was also there.
                <br>“As you can see, the furniture is extremely beautiful and the house is quite filled with them.
                Though I
                regret to say that the house is quite a ways away from downtown Kret...”<br>
                There was indeed a decent amount of inconveniences though I didn’t care much for them. As you know, I
                lived in the mountains training my sword for 3 years. In my eyes, these weren’t inconveniences.
                <br>“It’s a nice house. Can I buy it?”<br>
                “Ye… Yes of course!”<br>
                The realtor immediately bowed his head the moment I expressed my intention to buy the house. According
                to what I’ve heard, the price was cheaper than market value but due to the house being large the price
                was still fairly expensive, so there weren’t many buyers interested in it. The house was priced at 10
                million beruks. That’s a thousand gold coins. It certainly is a large sum of money, however that’s the
                minimum a quest offered for a Special rank adventurer.
                …The Black Dragon slaying quest was 10 billion beruks. Anyway, after finalizing the contract I returned
                back to the house I just bought and sat down on my bed. The bed was also provided but the doormat and
                bed sheets were newly bought. The bed was extremely comfy and seemed easy to sleep in.
                <br>“...I’m finally a rank 10 adventurer.”<br>
                I stared at my adventurer license that I received earlier today.
                …I was forced to become an adventurer by my master in the past. The me at the time felt indifferent and
                emotionless towards everything, I didn’t even know why I was alive. My master made me take the path of
                becoming an adventurer in order to give me a purpose. As expected from my Special rank master, they were
                able to get an exception to let me start from rank 7.
                Speaking of rank 7, it’s the starting point for the intermediate level of adventurers. To go into more
                depth, rank 10 to 8 are the lower ranks, rank 7 to 5 are the intermediate ranks, everything above that
                is considered the high ranks. rank 0 is considered to be a Special rank.
                Naturally, the other adventurers didn’t find it very amusing, being that I'm a beginner that doesn’t
                know anything. Yet I immediately registered as a rank 7 adventurer out of nowhere. The me in the past
                didn’t sense their irritation towards the situation but my master made me accept many quests in order to
                shut them up. In which I uninterestedly completed. Then before I knew it, I had become a rank 0
                adventurer just like my master. The haters diminished after becoming a Special rank adventurer but as
                usual, all I did everyday was complete quests. One day, I was suddenly given a task by my master. It was
                the slaying of the 1st Demon King’s underling the Black Dragon. My master said that I can live how I
                like if I was able to slay the Black Dragon. However, I didn’t see a reason to accept that assignment at
                the time.
                I thought I was living just fine completing quests without dissatisfaction and uninterestedly.
                Apparently, this robotic behavior benefited the elites very greatly. Since I would mindlessly complete
                their meaningless quests... in other words their odd jobs. I actually felt an emotion for the first time
                while completing one of these odd jobs, in which I witnessed a certain spectacle.
                While doing this odd job quest I coincidentally happened to see my first rank 10 adventurers. Despite
                doing a meaningless quest the kids were tackling it full on and were intently gathering herbs. Though at
                the time I couldn't comprehend why they were trying so hard.
                The purpose of an adventurer is to slay the demon kings’ monsters and pioneering undeveloped
                territories. They weren’t fighting monsters but instead they were just gathering herbs and cleaning the
                city. I didn’t understand them at all. Maybe that’s why they drew my attention and led to me observing
                them while I also did my quest. That’s when I quickly came to understand the value of their existence.
                The herbs that they gather become medicine, that medicine will then help not just adventurers but the
                lives of the city folk as well.


                * * *

                ——Around the time Bran purchased his house. At the Ledion Kingdom’s adventurer guild headquarters, a
                certain person was being summoned.
                <br>“...Huh. You bastards are persistent aren’t ya.” said the platinumed hair blue eyed woman.<br>
                Possessing the characteristic of elves with long ears and being so beautiful, she seems to be the
                personification of ‘beauty’. The elf girl has a fed up expression on her face and elegantly sits down in
                the guild chairman's office. This woman is Bran’s master and former rank 0 adventurer, ‘Sword Saint’
                Kurul.
                “Hmph... You must know why I’m being so persistent don’t you?” The middle aged man sitting across from
                her opened his mouth.
                The middle aged man is muscularly brawny and wearing a suit, exuding an aura that intimidates anyone
                that looks at him. His name is Baruga, the chairman of the adventurer guild and former rank 1
                adventurer. The reason he summoned the retired adventurer Kurul was regarding none other than the Black
                Emperor’s... Bran’s whereabouts. The guild who has been searching for Bran, has been monitoring Kurul
                even more closely since Bran’s disappearance. They don’t want to let her escape their eyes, as she may
                be the only person who knows of his whereabouts.
            </p>

                <script>(AdProvider = window.AdProvider || []).push({ "serve": {} });</script>
                </p>
                <p>
                <br>“I’m going to have you spill where he is.”<br>
                “Enough already. 3 years have already passed.”<br>
                “Exactly, it’s already been 3 years. It’ll be troublesome if he’s not here.”<br>
                “I don’t know and I don’t care.”<br>
                “You’re his master right? There are many quests piled up with his name on it.”<br>
                “Why are you only insistent on him? There are other rank 0 adventurers, aren't there?”<br>
                “...Those guys won’t move.”<br>
                Kurul laughed through her nose at Barugan’s suspicious statement.
            </p>
            <p class="image-box" style="text-align: center;"><img
                    src="https://github.com/flowerstranslations/images/blob/main/bth-1-2.jpg?raw=true"></p>
            <p><br>“Ha! It’s not that they won’t move but it’s that you can’t make them move right?”<br>
                “What’d… you say?”<br>
                Barugan then intensified his aura after hearing Kurul’s mocking remark, but Kurul intensified her own
                even furthermore as if striking down Barugan’s.
                <br>“Who are you trying to intimidate?”<br>
                “Uh!”<br> Barugan choked up from her intense aura.
                ——This is the difference between rank 1 and rank 0. From a ranking point of view there’s only one rank
                difference. However, there exists an immense disparity in power.
                <br>“In the first place, I’m only here because I’m obligated to do a duty from the past. If it wasn’t
                for
                that I would easily lose your monitoring.”<br>
                “...”<br>
                Kurul was speaking the truth. In order to properly monitor a Special rank adventurer, another adventurer
                of the same rank would have to monitor them for it to be effective. However, each Special rank
                adventurer is weird in their own way, making them nearly impossible to be controlled by the guild.
                <br>“...That’s why we need him. He actually used to accept our quests when he was a Special rank
                adventurer.”<br>
                “Quests? Don’t you mean odd jobs?”<br>
                “What’d you say!?”<br>
                “Are you saying that’s not what they are? ...Up until now, he didn’t have a mind of his own. You guys
                took advantage of that fact and used him day and night to complete your little jobs, didn’t you?”<br>
                Barugan couldn’t deny Karul’s remark. Bran was once a mindless robot who indifferently completed quests.
                Karul let out a sad expression for a brief moment.
                <br>“...I wanted to give him his own mind and purpose so I made him become an adventurer. It wasn’t to
                make
                him your guys’ toy.”<br>
                “...”<br>
                “He’s found his own purpose. You fools better not get in his way.”<br>
                “What! Don’t go, I’m not done talking to you!”<br>
                Kurul intensified her aura and left Barugan’s office without any further word from him.
                <br>“I wonder how he’s doing...”<br>
                In actuality, Kurul had an idea of where Bran was. Though she only knew what country he was in, she
                hadn’t heard exactly what city he was staying in. Regardless, she was happy to hear that he was doing
                okay.
                <br>“That’s right... I think I’ve fulfilled my obligations to a certain extent. This surveillance is
                getting
                annoying, I guess I’ll head over to where Bran is.”<br>
                Kurul started thinking about her pupil who she hadn’t seen in a long time, and she made up her mind.

                * * *

                After taking a breather at the house that I just bought, I visited the adventurer guild once more.
                Reason being that the day was still young and I was thinking I'd take on a quest to commemorate becoming
                a rank 10 adventurer today. I faced the quests posted on the quest board. There are a lot of quests that
                are up my alley.
                <br>“Oh, there’s even this...”<br>
                Amongst the quests are herb gathering, city cleaning, finding a lost cat, and even shopping odd jobs.
                It’s truly filled with quests considered to be trivial. Certainly, with just a glance, these quests look
                more suitable for a servant rather than an adventurer.
                “Nevertheless, looking at the amount there are, I can tell they’re not very popular.”
                Although the higher the rank is the less quests there are. There aren’t any quests for rank 0
                adventurers. Well, most rank 0 quests aren’t posted on quest boards. That’s because designated quests
                are more common starting from the middle ranks.
                <br>“It seems that monster hunting quests start coming in from rank 9 and above...”<br>
                From what I can see, there are posted monster hunting quests involving weak monsters like goblins and
                slimes. While observing the quest board another adventurer walked up to the board beside me. When I took
                a look at their eyes, they were staring at the rank 9 quests. After confirming the quests to a certain
                extent, they quickly grabbed a monster hunting quest, and then headed towards the reception desk.
                <br>“...Monster hunting quests are popular after all.”<br>
                It’s true that monster hunting quests have better rewards than herb gathering quests. Especially for
                beginner adventurers who are struggling to eat, they have to take on monster hunting quests when they
                can.
                <br>“Well whatever. I’ll just accept a herb gathering quest.”<br>
                I noticed something while checking the quests again. The herb gathering quests consisted of different
                types of herbs. For example, one quest had 10 Hyria and another quest had 5 Magika written on it. The
                front desk can show me a sample if I ask for one, so it shouldn't be a problem even if I don't know
                anything about these herbs.
                <br>“I guess I’ll look for the Hyria first.”<br>
                I grabbed the quest and headed towards the reception desk. Then just as I was heading over there, Rina,
                the one who handled my registration was available, so I decided to have her accept my quest.
                <br>“Hello, good afternoon.”<br>
                “I’d like to accept this request...”<br>
                <br>“I see. Well then, can I take a look at your adventurer license and the said quest?”<br>
                “Yeah.”<br>
                Rina grabbed my adventurer license and the quest and tossed them in the strange reception box. After a
                short while, she grabbed my license from the box and handed it back to me.
                <br>“I have returned your license. Your quest has been accepted. Your current quest has been recorded
                onto
                your license. Please confirm it.”<br>
                As Rina said, now carved onto my license was a transcription Ongoing Quest: 1. As usual, that box is
                strange. While thinking that, I suddenly remembered about the Hyria sample.
                <br>“Um, excuse me. Is it possible to show me a sample of the Hyria?”<br>
                “I understand. ...This is what it looks like.”<br>
                While speaking she brought out a unique leaf that was split into two. I immediately grabbed it in order
                to take a closer look...
                <br>“Tha—!?”<br>
                “? Is something wrong?”<br>
                I couldn’t reply to Rina’s question. Knowledge about Hyria came flooding into my brain the moment Rina
                handed it to me. Not only was it knowledge about how to distinguish the herb but the information even
                covered the characteristics, planting of the herb, medicine that can be created... and even the formula
                to craft it into a poison. Every possible information about it came flooding in. ...It happened again.
                Occasionally, just like now, knowledge that I have no idea where it came from, dumps into my head. I
                don’t even know what causes it. It just happens out of nowhere. I’ve learned about Hyria from my master
                before but like the information that poured into my brain just now, I didn’t know how to make it into a
                poison, let alone how to make it into a medicine.
                ...Maybe, something happened during my forgotten past. I would be lying if I say I wasn’t curious but, I
                can’t help but be curious. At any rate, I’m able to live a normal life now. I should worry more about
                the present and less of my past.
                <br>“...Sorry, it’s nothing. Thank you for showing me a sample.”<br>
                I received more information than needed to know. I then handed the sample back to Rina and left the
                guild building.

                * * *

                After leaving the guild, I headed outside the city in order to prepare for gathering the herbs.
                <br>“Well then, I’ll start searching for some Hyria. But…”<br>
                According to the information that I suddenly received, Hyria apparently grows everywhere. It's quite the
                generic herb, so it shouldn’t be too hard to find. I just wasn’t consciously aware of Hyria but now that
                I think about it I have a vague memory of seeing it from time to time.
                <br>“Now that I look carefully, they sprout here and there.”<br>
                With a quick glance I sporadically saw plants that look like Hyria.
                <br>“They might not be Hyria but let’s go ahead and collect them.”<br>
                I squat down for the closest Hyria.
                <br>“Hm… The leaf is split into two so it must be Hyria.”<br>
                I immediately went to collect the Hyria but it seems instead of pulling it out, cutting it from the stem
                may be the best method to harvest them. Then I–
                <br>“I’ll wrap the stem of the Hyria in a wet towel.”<br>
                Wrapping it in a wet towel will keep the freshness of the Hyria. That’s according to the information
                that I obtained out of thin air. I have no clue where it truly came from.
                <br>“Hm?”<br>
                In the middle of my thought I sensed something. I turned to that direction, and a semi transparent mushy
                silhouette came creeping towards me.
                <br>“A slime huh.”<br>
                Slimes are everywhere and are weak monsters but extremely strong slimes do exist. Of course, the slimes
                in the outskirts are weak. They don’t seem to have any intelligence but their hate for humans must be
                embedded into them, they’re underlings of the demon kings after all. The slime has a soft body, so it’s
                getting near without making a sound. That’s why there have been cases of people letting their guard down
                and being attacked from behind, having their faces smothered, and resulting in death by suffocation.
                Well, even if they don’t make noise, they’re presence is very noticeable so it’s easy to spot them.
                <br>“You picked the wrong person to mess with.”<br>
                Without having to pull out my sword, I squashed the slime with my foot. Killing monsters outside of
                quests can also be turned into money as long as you bring their parts as proof. In the case of slimes,
                you would need to bring the “nucleus” that’s inside it’s semi transparent body.
                <br>“Well it’s not like I need the money so I’m just gonna leave it there.”<br>
                I left the slime in its smushed state and continued looking for more Hyria to collect.

                * * *

                <br>“I guess this will do for today.”<br>
                The sun had set. I was finally satisfied and cut off my herb picking. As a result, I ended up going over
                the 10 I needed for the quest and collecting as many as 100. Hyria is highly reproductive, so they’ll
                grow back quickly. I may have gone a little overboard. That’s how engrossed I was. In the first place, I
                like work where I don’t have to think much. That’s why I didn’t dislike hunting monsters during my rank
                0 adventurer days. Though, that was the extent of my enjoyment. I didn’t feel real enjoyment from it. In
                contrast, I really enjoyed today's herb gathering.
                <br>“Now then, I guess I’ll head over to the guild and report my completed quest.”<br>
                I grabbed the Hyria that I gathered and returned to the guild. Rina was still working the reception.
                <br>“Excuse me.”<br>
                “Oh, Bran. Welcome back. How was your quest?”<br>
                “I was able to safely finish it. Can you process it for me?”<br>
                I lined up the Hyria that I gathered and lined them up on the reception desk. As expected, Rina’s eyes
                got big, shocked from the sheer number of herbs picked.
                <br>“Th, that’s a lot of herbs isn’t it...”<br>
                “It was fun, so I got a little carried away...”<br>
                “It was fun? Herb gathering was fun?”<br>
                “Yeah.”<br>
                “You’re a bit strange aren’t you. It will take some time to check these once so can you wait a little
                while?”<br>
                “Yeah, that’s fine.”<br>
                Rina then grabbed the herbs that I collected and took them to the back. Having nothing to do I just sort
                of stared inside the guild.
                <br>“The Forest of Demons has been a bit strange lately.”<br>
                “What do you mean by ‘strange’?”<br>
                “Monsters that are usually seen in deeper parts of the forest have been showing up much closer
                apparently.”<br>
                “Really!? We have to be wary about that...”<br>
                “Also, there’s a rumor of a roar being heard every night in the city.”<br>
                “Oh, I’ve heard that rumor as well. It’s a roar of a beast of some sort.”<br>
                “Maybe, there are beasts living within the city.”<br>
                “There’s no way. We have soldiers posted outside of the city 24/7. And plus, we would’ve heard about an
                incident if they were actually living amongst us.”<br>
                “I wonder if that’s true. I just hope nothing bad happens.”<br>
                I eavesdropped on the conversation that two adventurers were having at the pub. ...The Demon Forest huh.
                I’ve never been there but I’ve heard a rumor that the 3rd Demon King resides there... As the name
                implies Demon Kings are kings of monsters. Just like how it’s unknown when monsters started appearing,
                it’s unknown when the Demon Kings appeared. They’re also known as the Kings of Monsters. As they’ve hurt
                many humans in the past, they’ve become an enemy of humanity.
                Actually, long ago, a war broke out between humanity and the Demon Kings. However, I’ve heard that the
                3rd Demon King is actually quite moderate compared to the other Demon King’s. That’s why there are few
                reported injuries involving the monsters led by the 3rd Demon King. That’s why the Demon Forest is
                considered a step below the other Demon King dwellings, in terms of danger. Something strange is
                happening at the Demon Forest... I hope it doesn’t mean anything. While pondering, Rina returned to the
                reception desk.
                <br>“Sorry for the wait. You’re amazing Bran! All of the Hyria that you brought are in great
                condition!”<br>
                “I’m glad to hear that.”<br>
                “Perhaps, are you knowledgeable about herbs?”<br>
                “Not really. I just happened to be a little knowledgeable about Hyria.”<br>
                I might suddenly become knowledgeable about another herb like I did this time, but I have no idea.
                <br>“I see... Anyways, congratulations on completing your first quest!”<br>
                My first successful quest... It felt strange hearing that. I would accept quests that I despised during
                my time as the Black Emperor. Above all, my first quest was actually chosen by my master, and it was a
                monster hunting quest. Despite that, here I am… accepting a herb gathering quest and completing it...
                This was my first time experiencing the feeling of actually completing a quest. I smiled with emotions
                of joy bubbling within myself.
                <br>“...Thank you.”<br>
                After exiting the guild, I looked up into the sky. The sunset’s orange sky wraps me in its warmth. Today
                marks the day of my first completed quest as a rank 10 adventurer. Surrendering myself to this warm
                feeling, I stretch out my body.
                <br>“Uh. Well then, I guess I should head back home.”<br>
                I’ll accept another miscellaneous quest tomorrow.
                After deciding tomorrow's task, I went back home.
