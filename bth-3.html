            <p>Days after teaching Aria about herbs.
                She has smoothly completed quests and is now rank 9.
                Aria, unlike other adventurers who were only taking monster hunting quests, was completing both monster
                hunting quests and odd job quests. And now in the present, Aria offered to do a quest together and so
                we’re cooperating on the same quest.
                <br>“Hm… There isn’t any over here…”<br>
                “I also can’t find any over here”<br>
                The quest we accepted is a collecting quest for orem fruit that grows from a tree in the Demon Forest. I
                thought it was a monster hunting quest at first when Aria brought up the topic of the quest. Since
                forming a party is safer when taking on monster hunting quests. And more than anything, it’s rare to
                form parties for collecting quests, as it’s not really necessary. However, since Aria was the one who
                asked, I happily agreed. This is my first time stepping foot into the Demon Forest, since I’ve been
                focusing on herbs that grow in the plains. The quest item, orem fruit, apparently grows in the shallow
                parts of the Demon Forest. Though, even if it’s in the shallow parts it doesn’t change the fact that
                it’s still dangerous. You still have to be cautious of monster attacks around these parts. I sensed a
                monster mid-thought. I then turned my line of sight in that direction, on top of the tree next to Aria
                was a 2 meter long snake monster called… forest snake. It was obvious that it was waiting for the right
                time to jump out towards Aria.

            <div class="ad-box">
                <script async="async" data-cfasync="false"
                    src="//pl26314810.effectiveratecpm.com/9768483139ab06be220ee16bc7a6dfb9/invoke.js"></script>
                <div id="container-9768483139ab06be220ee16bc7a6dfb9"></div>
            </div>

            <p>
                <br>“Aria, look out!”<br>
                “Huh? AH?”<br>
                After I warned Aria who wasn’t aware of the forest snake, she immediately got into her battle stance.
                With a slight delay, the forest snake then sprung out towards her.
                <br>“Water Ball!”<br>
                “Shaaa!?”<br>
                After chanting the spell a blob of water emerged in front of Aria and crashed into the forest snake. The
                forest snake fell to the ground from the impact and its movement dulled due to the damage taken.
                <br>“Yaaa!”<br>
                Then, without giving it an opening to escape, Aria pulled out her hanging sword and severed the forest
                snake’s neck. Aria defeated the forest snake, gave out a sigh and smiled my way.
                <br>“Th… thanks Bran!”<br>
                “Not at all. At any rate, you’re pretty skilled with the sword aren’t you.”<br>
                A forest snake is a rank 8 monster and because it doesn’t even possess poison, it isn’t very strong. But
                its scales are hard, you need strength that can cut it in order to slice it. Aria’s swordsmanship is
                amazing considering that she’s a rank 9 adventurer but still demonstrated cutting through its scales and
                dropping its head.
                <br>“Y… you think so? I’ve done some special training in order to become an adventurer…”<br>
                “Oh… You’ve been aiming to become an adventurer for a while now?”<br>
                By nature, as long as someone can fight they can become an adventurer. In other words, this means that
                even thugs can easily register and become an adventurer. Despite it being life-threatening, becoming an
                adventurer itself is extremely easy. And so for that reason, it's rare for someone to train beforehand
                and aim to become an adventurer from the start. Since you can become one even without any training.
                Rather, most people who’ve been training their swordsmanship since childhood, generally aim to become a
                knight. Aria, then gave a bashful smile.
                <br>“Yeah. Actually… I’ve been training for 3 years… because the Black Dragon attacked the city that I
                lived in.”<br>
                “Huh?”<br>
                My eyes widened, surprised by Aria’s words.
                By Black Dragon… She means that Black Dragon right?
                Aria continued not noticing my surprise.
                <br>“The soldiers of my country fought desperately but the Black Dragon was strong… The city collapsed,
                and chaos fell upon it. At that time, I had gotten separated from my mother, and the only thing I could
                do was cry. Then, just when I thought all was lost… the great Black Emperor appeared!”<br>
                “……”<br>
                “The Black Emperor gallantly appeared! And let alone blocking the Black Dragon’s attack, he even covered
                the entire city in a remedy of healing rain! And he defeated the Black Dragon with a tremendous magic
                spell… Thanks to the Black Emperor I’m still alive today. I long to be just like him one day, and become
                an adventurer that can protect everyone… Is something wrong?”<br>
                “I-It’s nothing.”<br>
            </p>
            <p class="image-box" style="text-align: center;"><img
                    src="https://github.com/flowerstranslations/images/blob/main/bth-3-1.jpg?raw=true"></p>
            <p>
                I broke into a cold sweat listening to Aria’s story.
                So that’s how she viewed me…
                I only had my master’s assignment of defeating the Black Dragon on my mind at the time. I only protected
                the city because I would get an earful from the higher ups of the guild and the nobles of said country.
                To think that somebody would long to become an adventurer from my actions…
                <br>“At any rate, I longed to become just like the Black Emperor and became an adventurer.”<br>
                “In other words, you’re aiming to become a rank 0 adventurer?”<br>
                “That’s right… I hope I can reach rank 0 like the Black Emperor. Obtaining something like rank 0 is a
                dream within a dream after all. I’m taking things one step at a time, putting my all to complete every
                quest in front of me! Which, even if I can’t become a rank 0 adventurer I’m aiming to become an
                adventurer that can protect others!”<br>
                Aria visibly had a sparkle in her eye during her monologue.
            </p>

            <div class="ad-box">
                <script async="async" data-cfasync="false"
                    src="//pl26314810.effectiveratecpm.com/9768483139ab06be220ee16bc7a6dfb9/invoke.js"></script>
                <div id="container-9768483139ab06be220ee16bc7a6dfb9"></div>
            </div>

            <p>
                It’s true that it’s a harsh road to reach rank 0. I don’t know how much talent Aria has but at the very
                least she’s been training for 3 years and her swordsmanship is elite. If she does what my master did and
                goes under the wing of the right person she can become an excellent adventurer. Aria noticed something
                while I was busy thinking about it.
                <br>“Th… there it is! Isn’t that the orem fruit?”<br>
                In the direction that Aria pointed at, was a tree with an orange colored fruit hanging from it. Once I
                approached and picked the fruit, I had no doubt that it was an orem fruit.
                <br>“Yup. It’s definitely an orem fruit.”<br>
                “Alright! Do I have to be cautious of how I pick it?”<br>
                “No, you don’t have to be so wary when you’re picking this fruit, but you just need to be wary of
                picking it like you would for any other fruit, making sure you don’t damage it.”<br>
                “I see! For now I’ll go on ahead and pick it.”<br>
                Said Aria excitedly.
                <br>“!”<br>
                I followed in her steps by picking one myself, but then I suddenly felt a strong presence from within
                the depths of the forest. What’s… with this presence…
                A thick wave of magic can be sensed, one that even the Black Dragon that I once defeated, could easily
                get past. If I remember correctly, the 3rd Demon King is sleeping in this forest but is that true? It’s
                already been hundreds of years since the vanishing of each demon king. Which is why, it’s not certain
                whether any of the demon kings were truly alive or not. Though, this must mean that most of today's
                monsters are offsprings of the monsters that the demon kings created. There’s also a chance that they
                are secretly producing monsters while in hiding. As I turned my awareness towards the depths of the
                forest, Aria who finished her pickings, tilted her head.
                <br>“What’s wrong Bran?”<br>
                “No… it’s nothing.”<br>
                Certainly, I sensed a thick aura of magic but I didn’t sense an intent to kill. Although, things can
                change if we overstay our welcome.
                <br>“For now shall we head back?”<br>
                “Okay!”<br>
                I kept my guard up in the forest and somehow returned to the guild with no problems.

                * * *

                A few days after my party quest with Aria.
                I once again accepted an odd job quest.
                <br>“So this is the place?”<br>
                In front of me was a big orchid that bears lots of vividly bright oranges. All of which look incredibly
                tasty, with a citrus, refreshing aroma in the air. That’s right, for today’s quest I’m working as a
                helping hand for this orchid. I stepped into the orchid and immediately saw a man picking.
                <br>“Excuse me! I came from the adventurer guild quest!”<br>
                “Ohh, you accepted the quest!”<br>
            </p>

            <div class="ad-box">
                <script async="async" data-cfasync="false"
                    src="//pl26314810.effectiveratecpm.com/9768483139ab06be220ee16bc7a6dfb9/invoke.js"></script>
                <div id="container-9768483139ab06be220ee16bc7a6dfb9"></div>
            </div>

            <p>
                A middle aged likable looking man stopped working and headed towards me. The man had a sunny smile on
                his face and stook out his hand.
                <br>“I’m Mike. I manage this orchid.”<br>
                I shook his hand back and introduced myself.
                <br>“I’m Bran. I came regarding the picking helping hand quest…”<br>
                “Yeah, I see. As you can see, the orchid is quite big, so it takes us forever to pick it all by
                ourselves.”<br>
                When I looked at it closely, I noticed that there were other workers however, as he said when
                considering the size of the orchid they’re short on hands.
                <br>“Which is why I posted a quest in the guild but as expected no one’s come.”<br>
                As expected, this quest isn’t popular after all. Though I on the other hand showed up because I thought
                I should expand my field of experience.
                <br>“Well, whatever. I’d like to have you help us immediately but, do you have any experience in
                harvesting before?”<br>
                “No, it’s my first time picking oranges. However, I have picked orem fruit before from a quest.”<br>
                “I see, I see! You should be fine then. They’re both fundamentally the same after all. You’ll be fine as
                long as you know how to not damage fruit when picking them, that’s all that matters.”<br>
                “I understand. Oh, what’s the difference between one that should be harvested and one that
                shouldn’t?”<br>
                “I think you’ll be fine picking but… Oh, take a look.”<br>
                Mike said, showing a stronger yellow than usual orange.
                <br>“An orange with this kind of color isn’t ready to be picked, so it’d be very helpful if you can
                avoid picking these ones. But don’t worry about it if you mess up. It’s not that big of a deal!”<br>
                “I see. I understand.”<br>
                “Well then, use this knife and basket okay.”<br>
                I grabbed the tools from Mike, and started working right away. I tried to pick the fruit like I would
                with an orem fruit but I noticed that the stem was harder than an orem’s.
                <br>“I see, this is what orangia’s are like.”<br>
                Orangias are sparkling orange and tasty looking.
                <br>“I’ve seen them countless times lined up at the store but it’s a different thing to harvest them
                yourself.”<br>
                I refocused on picking them. I spent many hours focused and picking away. I briefly looked up and my
                eyes widened, looking out into the massive orchid that had yet to be harvested.
                <br>“Uhh… How many days is this going to take…?”<br>
                Goods loading quests sometimes leaked over to the next day but that’s the extent of it. 2 days is the
                max. But, the size of this orchid isn’t something that can be done in just one or two days.
                <br>“It’s going to take an incredible amount of time at this rate…”<br>
                The more I think about it the more I come to understand why it’s not a popular quest. The more time you
                spend working the less time you have to accept other quests, making a rank up a far way to go. However I
                don’t care about ranking up nor do I mind working long hours but if it’s going to finish the job faster
                and keep it from crossing over to another day…
                <br>“I guess I’ll give it a try…”<br>
                I repositioned the knife and quickly swung my arm. I precisely aimed for the stem of the orangias and
                cut them all off. The orangias then rapidly dropped.
                I caught them before they could hit the ground and put them inside the basket.
                <br>“Alright, this is many times faster.”<br>
                I was picking them one at a time up until now, but at that rate no matter how much time I have it
                wouldn’t be enough. I was also properly picking them and came to get a grasp on the positioning and
                hardness of the stem so I’m now able to do this new method. Mike came to check up on how I was doing,
                which I was now using my new fast method.
                <br>“Bran! So how’s it goin— HUH!?”<br>
                “Oh Mike! I’m using a new method to pick at the moment!”<br>
            </p>

            <div class="ad-box">
                <script async="async" data-cfasync="false"
                    src="//pl26314810.effectiveratecpm.com/9768483139ab06be220ee16bc7a6dfb9/invoke.js"></script>
                <div id="container-9768483139ab06be220ee16bc7a6dfb9"></div>
            </div>

            <p>
                For now, I thought it’d be faster to show someone. I once again swung my knife and in a blink of an eye
                cut the stems of the orangia hanging on the trees. Cautious of the fruits getting damaged, I collected
                all of the falling orangias.
                <br>“This is the method. What do you think?”<br>
                “Wh… what do I think…”<br>
                Mike’s eyes widened, checking every single orangia I harvested.
                <br>“Th… that’s amazing… Precisely cutting just the stem, and not damaging a single one… Ho… how did you
                harvest them so fast…?”<br>
                “I think we’ll finish early with this method.”<br>
                In reality, we’ll definitely finish early using this method. However, as expected Mike and the others
                can use this method so it's going to be on my hands to finish early. Ignoring Mike’s surprised question
                I continued to collect orangias one after another. But, as expected we couldn’t finish in 1 day. It
                ended up taking 2 days to finish.
                <br>“You’re amazing! You’re amazing Bran! It’s thanks to you that we were able to finish so fast!”<br>
                “I’m glad to be of help.”<br>
                “You’re more than just helpful! How about it Bran! Would you like working for the orchid!?”<br>
                My eyes got big in surprise, I didn’t expect Mike to do exactly what Berum did and offer me a job.
                <br>“Uhh… I’m really grateful for the offer but I still intend on working as an adventurer…”<br>
                “No way… Th– then will you accept my quest again!?”<br>
                “Of course!”<br>
                Mike was left very happy and I successfully completed the quest.

                * * *

                A few days after the harvesting quest.
                I’ve been completing odd job quests as usual but I decided to take a break because I noticed I’ve been
                working day in and day out like I used to do in the past. So I went out on a walk, also with the purpose
                of looking around the city.
                <br>“This is pretty nice.”<br>
                I whispered aimlessly walking around the city. I’ve gone around various countries and have hopped from
                land to land completing quests. However, it had a strong business vibe to it, I didn’t even go looking
                around the city once.
                …It was such a waste of an opportunity, now that I think about it. Each country has their own culture,
                despite having the opportunity to experience them all I was pressed with quests and didn’t even notice.
                <br>“Whatever. I’ll experience every little thing from here on out.”<br>
                The name Black Emperor still remains around the world. However, that name should go obsolete eventually
                and be forgotten. When that happens, I won’t have to worry about my magic and I’ll be able to tour the
                world more grandly. Of course in order to travel the whole world the demon kings’ territory must need to
                be liberated first…
                Anyways, until then I’ll just do odd jobs. As I was thinking about that, someone suddenly called out to
                me.
                <br>“Oh, Bran!”<br>
                “Tom!”<br>
                Tom the yakitori vendor was the one who called out to me.
                <br>“What’s up? You have a quest today as well?”<br>
                “No, today’s my day off.”<br>
                Tom then widened his eyes and smiled.
                <br>“I see, I see. It is true that you’re always working. Rest is also very important.”<br>
                “So it did look like I worked 24/7 after all.”<br>
                “Yeah, you go to the plains everyday and bring back the herbs you collected and you run around here and
                there helping people.”<br>
                “I see. If that’s what you say…”<br>
                I wasn’t really running around but from the point of view of the people around it seems like I’m working
                quite a bit.
                <br>“Though it’s not very tiring for me.”<br>
                “As expected, that’s very adventurer-like of you. You’re quite strong and durable. Though, it is very
                important to rest when you can. That’s why I’m glad to hear that you’re resting.”<br>
                “I’ll be careful.”<br>
                There’s no pressure to keep working like in the past. As Tom says, let's periodically rest. As I was
                thinking that Tom keenly continued.
                <br>“Regardless of that… you’ve helped out the townspeople quite a bit since you’ve arrived right?”<br>
                “Huh?”<br>
                I was surprised to hear that.
            </p>

            <div class="ad-box">

                <div id="container-9768483139ab06be220ee16bc7a6dfb9"></div>
            </div>

            <p>
                <br>“Why are you acting surprised? You complete the quest that we put out there don’t you? There were
                times in the past where herbs would often be out of stock but thanks to you periodically going out and
                collecting them for us we’ve stocked up on potions, it’s very helpful. Thank you.”<br>
                Indeed, I knew that herbs are very important for the townspeople. However, I didn’t expect odd jobs to
                be this helpful and receive thanks directly from the townspeople. Tom then let out a fed up sigh.
                <br>“Ha… It would be nice if the other adventurers also accepted our quests though.”<br>
                Due to the money and rank up potential monster hunting quests have, adventurers only accept monster
                hunting related quests. Guilds, researchers and nobles post a lot of quests and their rewards are
                significantly higher than the townspeople’s. As a result, the townspeople’s quests… in other words, odd
                jobs are avoided. However, I don’t think you can change the way people think about it. Everyone has
                their own lives to worry about and everyone has their own way of viewing things. While thinking about it
                Tom held out a cooked yakitori.
                <br>“Here. Grab one.”<br>
                “Huh, are you sure?”<br>
                “Ya! You’ve helped me out a lot as well after all. Rather, you’ve helped us all a great lot. This is a
                token of my appreciation. Please keep accepting our quests.”<br>
                “I understand. Thank you for the yakitori.”<br>
                I said, accepted the yakitori and left Tom’s side. I then took a bite out of Tom’s yakitori, after
                taking a bite out of its juicy tender meat, miso soup and Tom’s specialty sauce slushed around my mouth,
                entangling my taste buds.
                <br>“It’s delicious.”<br>
                I felt completely satisfied from the taste and reflected on my past.
                Now… that I think about it, I didn’t even get to enjoy meals during my Black Emperors. All I cared about
                was having sufficient nutrients and never thought about the taste of the food. The more I think about
                it, the stronger I feel that I was living like a dead man. During that time I did as I was told and
                completed nothing but quests. I didn’t have a mind of my own. When I think of that, it’s a good thing…
                that I’ve sprouted my own thoughts and opinions. I’m also very grateful for my master who looked after
                me. They made me become an adventurer in order to awaken my own train of thought. Thanks to them I’m who
                I am today. As I’m walking and thinking, one after the other, others besides Tom call out to me.
                <br>“Oh! Bran! Here, take one!”<br>
                “Thanks for the other day! Please accept my quest again sometime!”<br>
                “Is today your day off? Then here! Make sure you eat it and take it easy!”<br>
                Most of the people were handing me things like vegetables and general goods. It’s not a good thing to
                get things for free so I tried to decline them but they were persistent. This is different from before,
                I’ve formed a bond with the townspeople.As I’m walking feeling thankful, a store enters my line of
                sight.
                <br>“That’s…”<br>
                It’s a flower shop with various flowers lined up out front. It seems they don’t just sell flowers but
                they also sell different kinds of vegetables.
                <br>“Oh right, my house has a yard. Starting a garden is a pretty good idea.”<br>
                Especially because I just recently helped harvest at Mike’s orchid. It seems fun to grow them in your
                own home. The employees greeted me as I got close to the store.
                <br>“Welcome! Is there anything in particular you’re looking for?”<br>
                “I’m… actually thinking of starting a home garden…”<br>
                “I see! Then, how about something like this tomaruto?”<br>
                They said, showing a round red vegetable. A tomaruto has a lot of nutritional value and is uniquely
                juicy.
                <br>“Tomaruto’s are a good starter for beginners.”<br>
                “I see, then I’ll take it.”<br>
            </p>

            <div class="ad-box">

            </div>

            <p>
                They then showed me several other types of vegetables and flowers. I bought them all since I was already
                here. I then returned home, and planted all of the plants that I bought.
                <br>“The vegetables and flowers I bought supposedly don’t need much maintenance.”<br>
                Apparently they don’t even need to be watered every day. They’re completely for beginners. I felt
                content after watering my garden for the first time and took a bath. Like a day off would be for, I
                healed my fatigued body.

                * * *

                The day after my day off.
                I once again accepted an orem fruit collecting quest in the Demon Forest where I can’t forget the aura
                that I sensed in there. I headed over to Rina’s desk holding the quest.
                <br>“…Okay, the processing is complete. As usual you do nothing but gather quests…”<br>
                “It’s okay isn’t it?”<br>
                “I guess it is… Oh yeah, Aria also accepted the same quest just now.”<br>
                “Is that so?”<br>
                “Perhaps, you’ll bump into her. In any case, the Demon Forest is extremely dangerous compared to the
                plains, so please be careful.”<br>
                “Thanks.”<br>
                I said goodbye to Rina and headed on over to the Demon Forest.

                * * *

                <br>“Oh Bran…”<br>
                I… Rina, let out a sigh looking at Bran’s back. I met Bran by chance when he registered as an adventurer
                a month ago. I’m sorry to say this but my first impression of him was that he was an undriven person.
                Having unkempt black hair and blue eyes with no life within them. His facial features are refined but
                it’s a waste because of how he comes off. It’s arguable that he’s the weirdest adventurer amongst
                everyone that’s registered here in Kret. He actively accepts odd job quests that nobody wants to do and
                enjoys them. Normally, adventurers rank up in order to have access to more quests. Above all, the higher
                you go in the ranks the more special treatment you get from countries and the guild. Due to upper rank
                adventurers like rank 1 adventurers being so strong, every country does whatever they can in order to
                win them over.
                When it comes to the rank above rank 0 adventurers, just one rank 0 has the power to take over an entire
                country. For example, in a past war, the country with the support of a rank 0 adventurer absolutely
                demolished the opposite side. The guild now has a fundamental policy prohibiting adventurers from going
                to war. That’s how powerful upper rank adventurers are. This strength has led to countries going out of
                their way to invite these upper rank adventurers and buttering them up. Because of how lucrative it is,
                many adventurers aim for these ranks.
                Which… is why the news of the rank 0 adventurer Black Emperor’s retirement shocked the world. His age
                was never disclosed but he should still be young, since he hadn’t been a rank 0 adventurer for too long
                before throwing the rank away. Well us normal people wouldn’t understand why but he must’ve been going
                through something.
                At any rate, while everyone is trying their best to, even if it’s a little, move up the ranks as fast as
                possible, Bran is complacent in the rank he’s at. No matter how many times I propose the idea, he
                stubbornly refuses. He even hated ranking up to rank 8.
                Rina was standing in her usual reception desk, and had a bitter smile on her face when someone called
                out to her.
                <br>“What’s with that smile? Is something wrong?”<br>
                “Ah, Lena!”<br>
                “Maybe, it’s about him again?”<br>
                Lena knew that I was the one in charge of Bran. Though naturally, there isn’t a rule of receptionist
                being assigned to certain adventurers. Rather, I have heard of upper rank adventurers possibly being
                given a dedicated receptionist but that isn’t a thing for rank 8 adventurers like Bran. Yet, one way or
                another, I’m always the one working the desk when he decides to complete a quest.
                <br>“Yeah.”<br>
                “He accepted another odd job?”<br>
                “Yeah he did. The quest this time is the Demon Forest’s orem fruit gathering quest, so the difficulty is
                somewhat more difficult than the typical gathering quest…”<br>
                “So in the end he accepted a gathering quest rather than a monster hunting quest.”<br>
                That’s right, all he accepts are odd job quests like gathering quests after all. Of course, there are
                gathering quests among the higher ranks but those are in extremely dangerous areas so they’re not
                categorized as odd jobs. If he would at least accept a more difficult gathering quest then people around
                would stop making fun of him…
                <br>“Well glancing at him, it seems like he has no desire to do so.”<br>
                “D… don’t say that!!”<br>
                “But everyone thinks so as well don’t they? This may not be related but despite being an adventurer his
                hair is always a mess and his spirits aren’t high… An adventurer should have ambition. In a sense this
                would also cross him out of potential candidates.”<br>
                “Candidates?”<br>
                “Yeah, boyfriend candidates.”<br>
                “Ohh…”<br>
                Lena’s words reminded me of the topic that often comes up amongst the reception desk women. The topic
                being, what kind of adventurer would you like to marry. The reason why this topic comes up often is
                because there is a high number of adventurers and receptionists who end up developing feelings for each
                other, falling in love and getting married. That alone shows how often the two occupations come across
                each other. And for women receptionists, if they’re able to catch a young promising adventurer then,
                even without being a noble, they can live out the rest of their life leisurely. Hence why a lot of
                female receptionists actually became receptionists in the first place.
                “Speaking of candidates, Allen is cute and he just reached rank 6 recently. It looks like he has a
                bright future. Then the other candidate has to be rank 3 Kevin after all! He’s super cute and he’s so
                powerful, he reached rank 3 all by himself. And top of all that he’s a noble. There couldn’t be anyone
                more perfect.”<br>
                “Ha, ha…”<br>
                “But I heard Allen is transferring to a different area. As for Kevin, it’s incredibly difficult to even
                get a chance to see him… It’s truly a cold world out there, isn’t it?”<br>
                Indeed, Allen registered as an adventurer here in Kret and excelled. It’s said that at this rate it
                won't be a big deal for him to reach the upper ranks. I’ve encountered him many times at the reception
                desk but while many adventurers are somewhat rude, he was a very gentle-mannered young guy. However, it
                was refreshing to see because I don’t view adventurers with the same eye that Lena does.
                <br>“Now that I think about it, I’ve never talked about this kind of thing with you before. Do you have
                anyone you’re aiming for?”<br>
                “HUH!?”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                “Sure enough you’re aiming for a high rank adventurer right? However, everyone aims for a high rank
                adventurer so it’s best to have an eye out for a promising low rank, middle rank adventurer. But it’s
                pretty difficult to find someone in small Kret.”<br>
                Lena overwhelmed me and kept going on and on.
                H, hm… I haven’t given it that much thought before but, she wouldn’t let me off the hook if I answered
                with that would she.
                <br>“So, what do you think”<br>
                “Uh, yeah… If I had to choose, I think a low rank adventurer would be a good idea.”<br>
                “Oh, is that so? Then you mean you want to catch a promising guy—”<br>
                “N, no! That’s not what I mean… If I’m going to marry someone I don’t want them doing something so
                dangerous…”<br>
                “Huh…? But in that case then they wouldn’t earn much money right?”<br>
                I had a forced smile on my face as a reaction from Lena’s words.
                <br>“It’s true that we wouldn’t be able to live an affluent life but I’d like to continue working and
                more importantly I think it’s important for couples to live together.”<br>
                As Lena says, adventurers can earn a lot of money. However, it’s a job that matches the possible income
                with danger.
                …My father was an adventurer but lost his life. That’s why I don’t care if they don’t make a lot of
                money, I want to live the rest of my life together.
                <br>“Hmm… That’s unusual, Rina.”<br>
                “Y… you think so?”<br>
                “Yeah it’s unusual. But if that’s the case, wouldn’t it be difficult to live? The job of an adventurer
                is fundamentally dangerous… Actually, if it’s that one rumored guy then there shouldn’t be a reason to
                worry.”<br>
                “Are you talking about Bran?”<br>
                “Ya. After listening to you, he’s probably the closest thing to your ideal guy. But, you should give up
                on a guy who doesn’t show any promise like that. Even before I knew of him as the odd job guy, he didn’t
                look very reliable.”<br>
                “Ahahaha…”<br>
                I could only give a forced smile after hearing Lena speak so bluntly.
                After speaking about various things with Lena…
                As I was processing the quests of other adventurers as usual, the guild doors suddenly smacked open.
                <br>“T-There’s trouble!”<br>
                The adventurer shouted with a frantic look on their face and a faint pant.
                All of the adventurers were dumbfounded by the sudden situation, but one of them spoke out.
                <br>“Hey, hey what’s going on?”<br>
                “Th… there’s tyrant golems at the Demon Forest!”<br>
                “Wha—!?”<br>
                Everyone’s eyes widened after hearing the name of the monster yelled out by the adventurer.
                <br>“Don’t tell me you went deep into the Demon Forest?”<br>
                “No! It appeared on the outskirts!”<br>
                “What!?”<br>
                It was an emergency.
                Up until now, unless you went in yourself, an atrocious monster like the tyrant golem had never been
                seen outside of the depths of the Demon Forest. Seeing a monster above rank 4 outside of the depths was
                unheard of. However this time, the rank 3 tyrant golem had shown up apparently. Above anything else, the
                worst thing about it is that a tyrant golem has shown up on the outskirts. It would be unthinkable if
                that monster really did appear. There may be an overflow of these kinds of absurd monsters.
                <br>“S—Somebody call the soldiers!!”<br>
                “It’s already being done! But to defeat multiple tyrant golems is…”<br>
                “W—Wait wait, I thought there’s only one?”<br>
                “There’s 3 of ‘em…!”<br>
                Everyone fell into a silence after those words resounded. Just one tyrant golem is extremely dangerous,
                but there were 3. Just 3 tyrant golems have the power to destroy a small country. It can be said that
                the Rireito Kingdom is a small country.
                “Do we have any rank 3 and above adventurers!?”<br>
                “There’s none obviously. Not in this small country…”<br>
                Indeed, the Demon Forest is rich in various resources but it’s not very beneficial for high rank
                adventurers. Hence, most materials collected are plant based and there’s nothing but plant or insect
                type monsters. Meaning there’s no monsters that can strengthen gear.
                Above all, there aren’t any dungeons in this city… no in this country. Dungeons were created by the gods
                long long ago during the war against the demon kings. It was created with the purpose of strengthening
                humans, operating as a place of training. The monsters in these dungeons are the same monsters that the
                demon kings rule over. Once slain, they drop various loot and respawn. However, the loot they drop is
                different from their non-dungeon counterparts.
                Even then, because it’s a place made for training by the gods after all, there’s a chance for an
                adventurer’s physical and magical powers to improve from slaying monsters in the dungeon. This way the
                gods could strengthen humans to fight against the underlings of the demon kings and make them useful for
                the war.
                By the way, it’s said that the gods were born from nothing and created the humans on this planet. And as
                if going against the gods, the stars created the enemy of humanity, the demon kings. These demon kings
                then went on to create more monsters. In other words, the stars are the creators of the demon kings. The
                long lasting battle between the two, ended in both’s destruction.
                However, the humans and demon kings that the gods and stars created still remained. Furthermore, as
                inheritance from the war between the two, the dungeon was left behind for humans. Even till this day,
                they’re used as training areas for humans. Therefore, high rank adventurers dive into them in order to
                become stronger, obtain items and complete quests. That’s why a country that doesn’t have a dungeon like
                this one, hardly has any high rank adventures.
                …More than anything, it can be said that the reason why there aren’t many high rank adventurers is
                because the Demon Forest is relatively safe considering its danger level. That being said, the guild
                can’t just ignore it.
                <br>“THIS IS AN EMERGENCY QUEST!”<br>
                Org the Kret branch head, appeared after hearing the ruckus. Org is a respected former rank 4
                adventurer, who’s stepped back from the front lines and moved up the ranks to a branch head. That Org
                used his trained massive body and raised his voice so the entire guild could hear his voice.

                <br>“rank 8 and below adventurers do not get near the forest! rank 7 and above, patrol the city and
                guard it! This is an emergency quest. Don’t forget the terms of agreement, participation is basically
                mandatory!”<br>
                An emergency quest is a quest that is forcibly activated when a country of the branch is under danger.
                The activation of the quest forces middle rank adventurers… In other words all rank 7 and above
                adventurers accept the quest. It’s an adventurer’s obligation. On the other hand, adventurers don’t need
                to fight in wars.
                Org gave out orders one after the other and each person started to hectically move. That’s when I
                suddenly remembered something.
                <br>“O-Oh yeah! Bran and Aria…!”<br>
                “What’s wrong Rina?”<br>
                Org noticed my blue face and came asking.
                <br>“O-Org! Two adventurers are completing a quest at the Demon Forest right now!”<br>
                “What? What rank are they?”<br>
                “They’re rank 8 and rank 9!”<br>
                Org hit his forehead with the palm of his hand.
                <br>“What’s a rank 8… doing in the Demon Forest? Demon Forest monster hunting quests don’t start till
                rank 7.”<br>
                “They accepted the orem fruit gathering quest, which can be accepted starting from rank 9.”<br>
                “Shit. So it’s that quest… Most rank 9’s and rank 8’s do monster hunting quests in the plains in order
                to promote quickly, don’t they? So why are they doing such a quest…”<br>
                “Those… two often do odd job quests.”<br>
                “Oh, the odd job guy!"<br>
                It seemed Org knew of Bran and said his nickname that everyone mocks him with out loud.
                <br>“Geez, what bad timing… It's true that completing odd job quests is very helpful but doing nothing
                but odd job quests is a bit much. Does he not know how to fight?”<br>
                “Perhaps…”<br>
                Aria occasionally did monster hunting quests but Bran stubbornly never tried them. He has a sword as a
                weapon but it always looks brand new and unused whenever I see it. More than anything, there’s no way an
                adventurer doesn’t come across monsters on gathering quests. Usually a party would bring back the
                resources after slaying a monster to sell them, assuming it was unrelated to their quest. However,
                Bran’s never brought back any monster resources before. Also, it should be difficult to live off the
                income of a rank 8 adventurer…
                …But I’ve heard through a rumor that he owns a house. Maybe he’s surprisingly rich. Anyhow, there’s
                absolutely no way Bran is good at fighting. Org had a stern look on his face.
                <br>“…It’s too bad but we don’t have the resources to worry about them.”<br>
                “W-What are you saying!”<br>
                “You should know this. We can’t afford to split people up and execute a search and rescue for those two.
                Not in this emergency situation. The best we can do is look for them while we investigate the Demon
                Forest.”<br>
                “Th… thats…”<br>
                “As adventurers,. they’re going to have to protect themselves. The safety of the citizens comes first.
                Give up on trying to save them.”<br>
                Org went back to giving orders to the adventurers. Logically speaking, he made complete sense but I
                couldn’t easily accept it.
                <br>“Bran… Aria…”<br>
                —All I could do is pray for their safety.

                * * *

                <br>“That’s so weird… Even though there was some here the other day…”<br>
                I… Aria… came to the Demon Forest to complete an orem fruit gathering quest. I’ve been proactively
                completing quests in order to rank up to rank 8 but I’m not like the other adventurers who do nothing
                but monster hunting quests. I make sure to accept what’s known as odd jobs as well. To simply put it, I
                do them because I want to become an adventurer that can help all kinds of people. At a glance, people
                think that the purpose of an adventurer is to serve the people and slay monsters but that’s not just it.
                Adventurers can also find herbs that are hard to obtain to help the people that need them. Plus,
                according to Bran who’s taught me lots about herbs, herbs like the orem fruit are used for medicine that
                can cure specific illnesses. Though, because you need to step into the Demon Forest in order to pick
                them and there are safer and more profitable quests out there, orem fruit quests aren’t very popular.
                However, the other day I completed this quest with Bran and I was more than capable of defeating a
                monster in the outskirts, all on my own. Plus I’ve learned more about orem fruits and where they grow.
                Which is why I decided to take this quest again but on my own. Once I finish this quest I’ll get closer
                to a rank up and become helpful to someone. It was supposed to be killing two birds with one stone…
                <br>“Hm… Don’t tell me Bran beat me to the punch?”<br>
                I came to the place where the fruit I’m well knowledgeable about now is, but there wasn’t a single one
                hanging on the tree. Which is why I thought maybe the only person who’s more gung ho on odd job quests
                Bran had got here before me and grabbed all of the orem fruits. But it didn’t make sense because the
                quest didn’t ask for that many orems. Then, did this quest suddenly get popular and everyone grabbed
                them already? I couldn’t think of a reasonable reason, no matter how hard I thought about it.
                <br>“I guess there’s no helping it. I’ll just go around looking for other possible locations.”<br>
                The closest orem tree in the outskirts was completely wiped clean so I decided to head over to another
                gathering area I was aware of. But, in the end I couldn’t find any orem fruits no matter where I went.
                <br>“I wonder if there actually is any.”<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Maybe they only sprout during a certain time of the year but Bran never did mention that…
                I looked around thinking about that and suddenly noticed something.
                <br>“Huh? The grass is withering…?”<br>
                I didn’t really notice at first but when I took a closer look at the whole forest, for some reason I
                couldn’t sense the life of the plants. How should I put it, it seemed like their life was being sucked
                out of them.
                <br>“…It’s not just my imagination after all. I should probably end this quest…”<br>
                I had a bad feeling about this and decided to end the quest and head back to the guild.
                It was at that exact moment.
                <br>“Kiiii!”<br>
                “Huh!? A slash monkey!?”<br>
                A rank 8 monster, the slash monkey suddenly jumped out and attacked me. In a panic I raised my sword and
                slashed at the slash monkey but…
                <br>“Kiiii!”<br>
                “Hm!?”<br>
                The slash monkey that I thought was attacking me actually jumped over my head and onto the trees behind
                me. Soon after, other slash monkeys followed suit and were jumping through trees. Slash monkeys have
                sharp nails and mercilessly attack humans on site… at least normally…
                <br>“Kiikii!”<br>
                “Kikya! Kikya!”<br>
                Why are the slash monkeys running without even noticing me?
                It seemed like they were running from something…
                <br>“What the heck is go–”<br>
                “Ooooooooooo!”<br>
                “Hm!?”<br>
                I suddenly felt a tremendous pressure overcome me. I suddenly found it hard to breathe, it was as if
                this overwhelming power was crushing me.
                <br>“Ha… Ha…!”<br>
                Before I knew it I was kneeling and desperately looking around. Suddenly, something unexpectedly jumped
                in front of me.
                <br>“Wh… what…?”<br>
                It was a huge monster with a humanoid build. It was made out of stone and stone and wrapped in plants. I
                knew about the monster that fits the description, a golem. A golem is basically placed between rank 5
                and rank 7 due to the composition of their bodies. Naturally, rank 5 monsters are out of my league. I’ve
                never even seen a rank 7 monster before.
                …No, I’ve seen the rank 0 monster the Black Dragon in the past but I’ve never faced them the way I am
                now. Which is why, standing off with the rank 5 golem made my dream of becoming a splendid adventurer
                like the Black Emperor, feel impossible. That’s how out of my league I felt. So this is the level of a
                rank 5 monster. Maybe this golem isn’t the same as a normal one, maybe it’s stronger than normal. No
                matter how hard I thought I couldn’t see a scenario where I would win.
                <br>“Ha… Ha…!”<br>
                I tried to control my semi-conscious pants but as the golem got closer the stronger his overwhelming
                pressure got.
                I-I have to run…!
                Despite my mind trying to run away, my body was shaking and wouldn’t move.
                <br>“Ooo!”<br>
                “Heh!"<br>
                The golem’s head moved.
                It’s red inorganic eye locked on to me.
                <br>“Oooooooooo!”<br>
                “Ahhh!!”<br>
                The golem raised its terrifying roar and a wave of its magic released from its body. The thick magic
                accompanied the roar physically and turned into a shockwave that sent me flying. Unable to find my
                footing, I was flung into a tree, nailed to it.
                <br>“Ahh!”<br>
                I bear the pain and somehow stand on my feet. I noticed that I slipped out of its magic pressure.
                <br>“I… I have to run…!”<br>
                I desperately ran away while covering my body. However, the golem didn’t let me go.
                <br>“Ooooooooooo!”<br>
            </p>

            <div class="ad-box">
                <script async="async" data-cfasync="false"
                    src="//pl26314810.effectiveratecpm.com/9768483139ab06be220ee16bc7a6dfb9/invoke.js"></script>

            </div>

            <p>
                The golem then raised both hands and slammed them into the ground. The moment its hands hit the floor,
                the ground started to shake in a wave-like motion. The ground moving like a ripple of water, had
                significant cracks building up, while the surrounding trees and soil came crashing down on me. I tried
                to escape, but this damaged body of mine couldn’t move well and got sent flying once again.
                <br>“Ugh…”<br>
                Soaring in the air like a wood chip, I couldn’t throw up my guard in time and violently smacked into the
                ground floor.
                <br>“Uh… ugh…”<br>
                My body can’t move anymore.
                <br>“N… n… no.”<br>
                I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die.
                Despite begging for dear life, my consciousness was fading.
                Is this really where I die?
                I guess… in the end, I wasn’t able to become an adventurer like the Black Emperor.
                An adventurer that can save someone…
                I naturally flooded with tears, and my vision became hazy. I could see the golem standing in front of me
                with both hands raised, ready to finish me off.
                That’s the last thing I saw before my consciousness faded.

                * * *

                <br>“Hm?”<br>
                I… Bran… came to the Demon Forest in search of orem fruits.
                However, as soon as I entered the Demon Forest I remembered the strange aura I felt in the forest.
                <br>“Is the forest’s magic depleting…?”<br>
                Speaking of the Demon Forest, plants grow due to the abundance of magic the forest has. Because of this
                it’s home to unique herbs. However, not only does this magic grow plants but it also raises dangerous
                monsters. Though, the magic level is similar to the plains, so there aren’t many monsters in the
                outskirts. That’s the kind of place the Demon Forest is but for some reason I couldn’t sense its magic
                nor its life. Proof of this, the plants didn’t look well and some parts were withered.
                <br>“It dramatically changed this much in just a few days…?”<br>
                At any rate this is where the 3rd Demon King sleeps. Perhaps this happens from time to time in this
                unique forest.
                <br>“Well whatever, for now I’ll just finish up the quest.”<br>
                The Demon Forest was different from usual so I tried to finish the quest quickly and return back, so I
                checked out the orem fruit tree that I was familiar with.
                But…
                <br>“Huh? There isn’t any…”<br>
                Not a single orem fruit was hanging on the tree. I more or less had a similar experience gaining
                knowledge of the orem fruit, like I did with the Hyria herb. But according to the knowledge about orem
                fruits, they grow all year round.
                <br>“…It also doesn’t look like a monster ate them.”<br>
                I made sure to check the floor around the area for monster footprints but I didn’t find any. More than
                anything, I didn’t even find any leftover orem fruits on the ground.
                <br>“Is it possible they just disappeared without someone picking them or eating them?”<br>
                Perhaps, due to the strange situation that’s going on the tree absorbed all of the fruits. If that’s so
                then that means everything’s life and magic force is being absorbed. So much so that the orem fruits all
                disappeared in an instant.
                Then where’s the absorbed magic going to…?
                <br>“!”<br>
            </p>

            <div class="ad-box">
                <script async="async" data-cfasync="false"
                    src="//pl26314810.effectiveratecpm.com/9768483139ab06be220ee16bc7a6dfb9/invoke.js"></script>
                <div id="container-9768483139ab06be220ee16bc7a6dfb9"></div>
            </div>

            <p>
                At that moment…
                I felt a massive magic aura, a little away from me. At the very least it’s a rank 3 monster.
                <br>“There's 3 monsters in the outskirts?”<br>
                This is according to what I’ve heard but the strongest monster in this forest is supposed to be rank 5.
                …To be accurate, it’s what’s been confirmed to be in the Demon Forest. I’ve never travelled in the
                depths but the deeper you go the stronger the monsters get. On top of that, monsters that don’t normally
                form groups start attacking in groups. This is what makes the Demon Forest terrifying. Adventurers can’t
                advance through the forest because of the pressure that the series of attacks puts on them. That’s why
                no one truly knows what monsters are lurking in the depths.
                <br>“This level of monster came out to the outskirts?”<br>
                Well honestly speaking I could care less why such a monster has appeared. I cared more about the fact
                that because of this magic I couldn’t collect my orem fruits.
                <br>“I can’t complete my quest like this.”<br>
                I quickly ran out and headed towards the source of this magic. I then saw the silhouette of a golem.
                <br>“Isn’t that a rank 3 tyrant golem!?”<br>
                I then noticed Aria laying on the ground in front of the tyrant golem. When I took a closer look at the
                situation, Aria was covered in blood and the tyrant golem had their arms in the air about to crush Aria.
                <br>“Like I’ll let you do that.”<br>
                “OoooO!?”<br>
                I cut the distance in an instant, kicked the tyrant golem and sent it flying. It was multiple times
                bigger than me but thanks to my magic amplifying the strength of my body, I was able to easily blow it
                away. However, as expected from a rank 3 tyrant golem… It stabilized itself while being blown away and
                came thrusting back towards me.
                <br>“Isn’t he moving too fast for his size?”<br>
                I knew information about tyrant golems but it was my first time fighting one. Most other golems'
                movements are slow because of the composition of their bodies. However this golem’s velocity surpassed
                my anticipation and was plunging towards me. Though, in the end the size of its body has to be too big
                to make sharp turns. Which is why I thought of avoiding it but Aria’s behind me. I can’t pick her up and
                avoid it, the golem’s too fast.
                I guess I have no choice…
                <br>“Don’t think badly of me…”<br>
                I unsheathed my sword and charged towards the tyrant golem. The moment we met, I bent to my knees and
                slipped to the pocket of its chest and thrusted out my sword and in one slice, I sliced between its
                legs.
                <br>“OoooO!?”<br>
                The slice started from between the legs and ended at the top of its head, splitting the tyrant golem
                into two pieces. Due to the inertia of the tyrant’s charge, it headed towards Aria. But because it was
                split into two, they missed Aria and fell down. I confirmed the tyrant golem was dead and lowered my
                sword. I then quickly ran over to Aria. She lost a lot of blood and lost consciousness.
                <br>“It looks like she’ll be fine with this potion I have on me.”<br>
                I had a lot of top quality potions still left from my Black Emperor days. And I carry them ready just in
                case. I sprinkled one of them onto Aria’s wounds. Her wounds were clearing up.
                <br>“Hm… This one’s good for now… Now this one over here…”<br>
                “Oooooo!”<br>
                “!”<br>
                I picked up Aria and was ready to withdraw from the forest. Somehow another tyrant golem appeared in the
                depths of the forest. Plus…
                <br>“Ooo…”<br>
                “Ooooo!”<br>
                “Hug!”<br>
                “There’s two more?”<br>
                The two tyrant golems suddenly appeared.
                …This is strange. It would be believable if just one tyrant golem happened to cross into the outskirts.
                But two showing up is a different story. Also tyrant golems don’t form groups together in the first
                place.
                <br>“OooooooO!”<br>
                “Hm!”<br>
                One of the tyrant golem attacked me with terrifying speed. While holding Aria, I dodge the attack.
                Though as if expecting me to dodge it, the other tyrant golem came to attack me.
                <br>“How depressing.”<br>
                I used the tyrant golem’s thrown arm as a scaffold and leaped away. The tyrant golem’s red eye then
                glistened.
                <br>“Seriously.”<br>
                The instant I jumped away a ray of light beamed from the eye. The ray of light pierced the ground where
                I was standing just a second ago. After a brief moment of silence the ground blasted open.
                <br>“They can use beams as well?”<br>
                They kept shooting beams as I avoided them and in between the beams, they swung their arms at me.
                <br>“These guys…”<br>
                I looked at their movements and raised my eyebrows.
                …No matter how I look at it, they're in sync. But as far as I know, tyrant golems are not intelligent
                enough to be doing something like synchronization. Or maybe, someone’s controlling them…
                <br>“There’s no point in thinking about it…”<br>
                Normally I wouldn’t be struggling but I have Aria on me right now. I can’t move as sharply as I want to
                with her. I can use magic but… I’m still in the outskirts of the forest. If I use it here then someone
                who excels in magic detection may detect residue of my magic if they pass through here. If they examine
                it they’ll know immediately that it’s the Black Emperor’s magic. If I’m found out then I’ll have to
                return to being the Black Emperor. That’s the last thing I want. That being said, I can’t just do
                nothing.
                <br>“There’s no helping it. Sorry Aria. I’m going to be a little rough.”<br>
                I put Aria over my shoulder and pulled out my sword once again.
                Then…
                <br>“Ha!”<br>
                “OooooO!?”<br>
                I instantly approached one of the tyrant golems and as we passed one another, I decapitated its head.
                The headless tyrant golem took a few stumbling steps and fell flat onto the ground.
                <br>“Oooooo!”<br>
                “Alright.”<br>
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                Right after finishing my swing, the other tyrant golem took the opening to begin another attack.
                However, I predicted that to happen so I immediately jumped away. In that moment, the tyrant golem swung
                down its arm and slammed them against the ground. The ground and trees popped out.
                <br>“They have a ridiculous amount of power.”<br>
                I soared into the air, using the popped up ground as scaffolds, and sporadically jumped through them.
                The tyrant golem tried stopping me by firing off beams but none of them hit me. And then just like that,
                I snuck behind it.
                <br>“Hmph!”<br>
                “OooooO–”<br>
                The tyrant golem then tried to face me by turning around but by that time it was already too late. I had
                split it in half from the top of its head down. The perfectly cut in two tyrant golem was completely
                silent. I checked there weren't any other monsters around and sheathed my sword.
                <br>“Not bad, I guess.”<br>
                I used to live with my master the Sword Saint but I didn’t train in swordsmanship itself much.
                …No, maybe that’s a little misleading. My master taught me how to wield a sword from start to end. But,
                they taught me magic much more thoroughly. I don’t know why they pushed magic onto me more than
                swordsmanship when they’re a swordmaster. Though, it’s that same magic that gave me the name Black
                Emperor.
                Thanks to that, I won’t be discovered as the Black Emperor as long as I don’t use magic. That’s why I
                needed another method to fight and trained my swordsmanship for 3 years. I reapplied what my master
                taught me at the time and thoroughly went over them in my training. There were rank 3 monsters in the
                place that I trained but the tyrant golem wasn’t one of them.
                <br>“I’m glad I got to try it out on them.”<br>
                The strength of a golem varies greatly depending on the materials used to make them. This time it was
                mainly composed of stone, soil and wood but its magical powers were uncommonly strong and its body was
                harder than that of a regular ore-type golem. I was able to slice it in half with one slice, so for now
                I guess my swordsmanship passes.
                <br>“Well, then now… It’s a good thing that I was able to defeat them but what should I do with their
                remains…”<br>
                It would be nice if I could just leave them like that, but I can’t do that. First, Aria came across this
                tyrant golem and a loud confrontation with them so the guild should have caught wind of the tyrant
                golem's existence. The best option is to wipe their remains with no trace but…
                <br>“Hmm… How do I do that…?”<br>
                There’s actually a way to erase the evidence completely. There's a type of magic that only I can use,
                that can get it done. If I use it, not only will it erase the remains of the tyrant golems but the magic
                residue.
                But…
                <br>“My master told me not to use it much…”<br>
                I don’t know why my master told me that but they prohibited me from using that kind of magic during my
                Black Emperor days. The ban was more or less lifted once I retired but I was told to try to avoid using
                it as much as possible. Much less, I was told to never use it with any humans around. Luckily, Aria is
                knocked out and no one else is here so no one will notice it.
                …There’s no other way. I’ll quickly use it and head back.
                As I made my decision, and tried to activate my unique magic…
                <br>“Huh!?”<br>
                I suddenly felt the aura of an enormous amount of magic. It seemed like it was spreading from the Demon
                Forest’s trees— no, from its entire soil. Above all, my eyes widened by the vastness and density of it.
                <br>“What is it…?”<br>
                This wasn’t comparable to the rank 0 Black Dragon that I once defeated… Something that releases
                something like this…
                <br>“Wha–!?”<br>
                While thinking I noticed that the vast magic moving around was pouring into the tyrant golem that I had
                decapitated. Furthermore, the other tyrant golem body parts were gradually assembling. When I moved my
                line of sight at their bodies which were floating up in the air, I noticed the magic was being absorbed
                into their bodies.
                <br>“What’s going on…?”<br>
                I quickly wielded my sword and got into a stance, and the three tyrant golems fused into one.
                <br>“They’re…”<br>
                An atrocious amount of magic that couldn’t be compared to the tyrant golems that I had just dealt with,
                was dwelling. The span has also grown twice as big as before.
                <br>“What is this thing?”<br>
                I learned a decent amount about monsters from my master. On top of that I also came across different
                kinds of monsters when I was the Black Emperor. Despite that, in front of me was an unknown monster.
                …The magic that I had sensed a second ago is now dwelling within the golem. The magic inside wasn’t just
                the new magic but also the magic that resided in the tyrant golems, reviving them and making them
                stronger. Based on the essence of the magic, it’s by no means inferior to a rank 1 monster. While
                observing it, the golem’s eyes sparkled red towards me.
                <br>“Hm!”<br>
                I instantly jumped back as a red beam shot off. With tremendous force, the place I was standing at
                exploded.
                <br>“Hey, hey, hey.”<br>
                I dodge the approaching fragments of the explosion, trees and ground, and distanced myself from the
                golem. The area that the red beam impacted was completely obliterated. The people in town must’ve heard
                that. Luckily that beam was aimed at the place that I was standing but it’s frightening to imagine what
                would’ve happened if it was headed towards the city.
                <br>“I don’t have time to be playing around.”<br>
                While still holding Aria, I raised my sword and in a blink of an eye closed the gap between me and the
                golem. And as soon as I arrived I slashed at it.
                However…
                <br>“Wha–”<br>
                The golem was faster than the tyrant golems and evaded it. Furthermore, it then rotated to my back and
                swung its strengthened arm. Without hesitation I dodged the attack but a tremendous gust of wind came
                from the fist and attacked me. The wind cut down the trees as well.
                <br>“As I thought you’re getting stronger.”<br>
                It was naive of me to think that only their magic powers had gotten stronger. I repositioned my sword
                stance and reapproached the golem. The golem swung down its arms in order to intercept me.
                <br>“Alright.”<br>
                I dodged the attack by a hair, and slashed its arm.
                However…
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                <br>“It’s hard.”<br>
                The materials it’s made out of is the same as the tyrant golems so I thought I could cut it down with
                just one slash. But for some reason the golem defense ability has gotten stronger. This is troubling.
                <br>“Is that magic increasing its defense?”<br>
                The magic that I had sensed within the depths of the Demon Forest. It’s reasonable to assume the cause
                being that magic since it created this golem and made its attacking abilities stronger.
                If that’s so…
                <br>“Then I have to cut through it, along with its magic.”<br>
                Going with the momentum of my slash I hook around to it’s back. I once again swing my sword upwards in
                between its legs. The golem then quickly attempted to block the attack by rotating its arms. However,
                those arms were easily cut through.
                <br>“No matter how hard something is, there’s always a way to deal with it.”<br>
                Up until now I’ve been using my sword normally but I dressed in my magic this time. Because of that my
                magic interfered with the golems magic and was able to cut it like normal. I brought back my sword and
                the turning golem fell down. With that, I rotated my sword and cut the golem as it was turning.
                <br>“———”<br>
                The golem stiffened and all of the materials its body was covered in such as soil and wood, fell to the
                ground. The golem then oddly disintegrated into the air.
                <br>“It disappeared…”<br>
                It was my first time seeing a monster disappear like that. Especially for a golem, as their materials
                typically disassemble on the ground. But, this golem didn’t leave a single thing behind and vanished.
                <br>“Although I don’t personally need it, it’s an annoying monster for other adventurers.”<br>
                Adventurers desire resources from monsters as they can strengthen the fighting power of an adventurer.
                Since, these materials can be used to craft different kinds of equipment. But the entire body
                disappeared, so other than defeating the monster it would’ve been a huge loss for an adventurer. Plus
                it’s unusually strong, so that would’ve pissed them off even more.
                <br>“Now then… there aren’t any more left are there?”<br>
                I once more was wary of the area but I didn’t sense the presence of a monster. I then turn my attention
                towards the depths of the forest.
                <br>“I guess I’ll head back for now…”<br>
                I was curious but Aria’s safety came first. Making my decision, I turned my back against the forest and
                headed back to the guild.

                * * *

                <br>“Hm… U…Uh? Where am I?”<br>
                “A-Aria! I’m glad you’re away!”<br>
                I woke up and Rina, the receptionist, came plunging at me with a relieved look on her face. With a foggy
                mind I look around and notice the guild had a hectic vibe in the air.
                <br>“I’m at the guild? My quest…?”<br>
                As I spoke, I remembered what happened. Th… that’s right. I went to the Demon Forest for my quest. But I
                noticed something strange was going on in the forest. When I tried to leave, a powerful golem attacked
                me.
                <br>“There’s danger! There’s a golem…!”<br>
                “It’s okay, the guild is already aware of it.”<br>
                “I-I see…”<br>
                The city would be in danger if the golem came attacking so I thought I needed to let everyone know as
                soon as possible but I’m relieved to find out that they were already aware of the situation. As I
                thought that, Rina’s expression got serious.
                <br>“Aria. What happened in the Demon Forest?”<br>
                “Huh? What happened? I was attacked by a golem…”<br>
                Wait what? I was attacked by a golem right? So why am I still alive? I thought I was definitely going to
                die. I still remember that moment. But, I’m alive. Rina explained to the confused me.
                <br>“Bran accepted the same Demon Forest quest and saved you.”<br>
                “Huh, Bran did!?”<br>
                True, it isn’t a weird coincidence that Bran was in the Demon Forest as well. Since he’s the one who
                taught me how to complete the orem fruit quest. However, the story of Bran saving me is strange.
                <br>“H-How…?”<br>
                “According to Bran, the tyrant golem wasn’t there when he found you.”<br>
                “T-There’s no way it wasn’t there!”<br>
                “Ohh, we also think so too.”<br>
                Rina also agreed. After all, I even witnessed them aim and swing their arms down at me. If that’s the
                case then what in the world happened…
                There’s no way that Bran defeated it!?
                “But there’s no way that Bran defeated it.”<br>
                Rina answered me as if she was reading my mind.
                “Ah…”<br>
                I… indeed this may be rude but there’s absolutely no way that I’d believe he defeated it. I’ve only done
                quests with him a few times but I’ve never seen him fight before. Naturally, sometimes monsters attack
                us during our gathering quests. However it’s always me who fights the monster.
                …Well I guess the monsters always appear near me so I have no choice but to fight them instead.
                <br>“But Bran also said nobody else was there when he found you.”<br>
                “T-Then does that mean it let me go!?”<br>
                “There’s no way it let you go! If that were the case, then it’s strange that you healed wounds.”<br>
                After she told me that I looked at my scuffed up body and didn’t find a single wound. In actuality, my
                body showed traces of being attacked and my gear was battered as well.
                Right… There’s no way a monster that attacked someone would heal their wounds themselves…
                <br>“Above all, a fragment of the intense battle could be seen from the city. So there’s no doubt that
                someone was fighting the tyrant golem.”<br>
                “I see…”<br>
                “Maybe, luckily, a high ranking adventurer happened to be nearby. For example a traveling rank 0
                adventurer who doesn’t stop anywhere…”<br>
                …There’s no way it was the Black Emperor right?
                I’ve heard that the other rank 0 adventurers also do what they like and basically don’t have a place
                they stay in. Though, I’ve never heard of them traveling in the direction of this country. Whoever it
                was I want to say my thanks to them. Rina then let out a sigh.
                <br>“But… from looking at your reaction it seems you also don’t know what happened do you?”<br>
                “I’m sorry… But I can talk about everything that happened before I lost consciousness!”<br>
                “I’d love to hear it! Including it with Bran’s account, it’ll help add more details to understand the
                situation better.”<br>
                I then went on to describe my situation all the way up till I lost consciousness.

            <p>
                Around the time Bran returned to the city.
                Deep inside the Demon Forest was the 3rd Demon King Natural with a stern expression.
                <br>“As I thought, my enchanted underling wasn’t enough after all.”<br>
                The monster Bran fought was a monster that Natural sent through the forest and enchanted them directly.
                Therefore, despite being a rank 1 monster, it boasted the strength equivalent to that of a rank 0
                monster. However in spite of that, Bran defeated the monster.
                <br>“I’m not particularly surprised. It’s the 6th Demon King after all…”<br>
                There was something on his mind that he couldn’t figure out about the defeat of his underlings. It was…
                <br>“Why didn’t they use any magic?”<br>
                Natural had an idea of how the fight went and was surprised to know that his underlings were defeated
                without magic being used. The reason why he was shocked by this, is the fact that the 6th Demon King was
                known for their magic abilities.
                <br>“Also, that feeling… it’s that weapon called a sword that those humans use right? Maybe it was just
                my imagination…?”<br>
                The only things Natural can perceive is what kind of attacks were made and what kind of attacks were
                received. In other words, Natural had no idea that Bran was a human.
                <br>“Anyhow, despite being dangerous enough with just magic, they’ve come back even stronger!”<br>
                The 6th Demon King was the exact personification of destruction. The 6th Demon King actually was born
                after the disappearances of the gods and the stars. This 6th Demon King was different from the other
                demon kings. The stars didn’t create them. They were birthed from the hatred that the gods and stars had
                for each other. The 6th Demon King destroyed everything they touched. They had a special magic ability
                that erased everything. Furthermore, unlike the other demon kings the 6th Demon King had no ego and did
                not care whether it was human or monster, they killed them all.
                Despite the purposes of both the gods and stars being different, they were both in a fight for world
                supremacy. But because the 6th Demon King was so destructive they were on the verge of destroying the
                world and led to a hostile relationship with the other demon kings. Consequently the 5 demon kings
                including Natural put their lives on the line and fought the 6th Demon King, and were supposed to have
                defeated him. When the 6th Demon King was defeated, they had no reason nor logic; they were purely an
                existent that manifested and spread destruction. They didn’t fight close-quarters and use a sword. Which
                is why the 5 demon kings focused on that aspect and successfully defeated him.
                However, that same demon king’s presence has appeared in Natural’s Demon Forest. Furthermore, the owner
                of that presence defeated Natural’s underlings with a weapon. In other words, there’s a high likely-hood
                that the 6th Demon King has resurrected with reason and logic.
                <br>“This… genuinely needs to be looked into. But how would I do that…”<br>
                Natural had actually exhausted a lot of their magic from their fight with the 6th Demon King and was
                replenishing in the Demon Forest. He was able to recover enough to awaken but he has yet to recover
                enough to leave the Demon Forest. It was the same for the other demon kings who also retreated to their
                territory and shut themselves in to rest.
                <br>“I could send another tyrant golem but the human city seems to be in some kind of uproar, above all
                the opponent is the 6th Demon king. They’ll just end up destroying them again. What should I do…”<br>
                Natural was at a loss… He didn’t know that this encounter would be soon.
